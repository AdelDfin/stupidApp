# Menu App

I like jquery in such a way that I had wondered how jquery was built up together and I decided to read its source code. I wanted to utilize what I have learned in an application example.

In this menu app example I created two versions. I built two versions of a menu application. The first one using jquery and the other using vanilla JavaScript. I made a jquery's animate()-like method. The version where I use vanilla JS preformed much faster than the other one, and I am really proud of it.
